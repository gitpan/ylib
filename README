NAME
    ylib - Add paths to @INC from a config file

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      # in .mylib file
      /home/david/some/library/path
  
      # from the command line
      $ perl -Mylib -E 'say for @INC'
      /home/david/some/library/path
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    The "ylib" module adds paths to @INC from a configuration file named
    ".mylib" in which each line represents a library path. The ".mylib" file
    can be either in the current directory and/or in the user's home
    directory. It is equivalent to calling 'use lib' on each path.

    Note: "ylib" will issue a warning if a path in ".mylib" can't be found.

USAGE
    Occasionally, it's useful to customize @INC on a per-directory basis
    without changing the global "PERL5LIB" environment variable. For
    example, when developing or testing code that requires uninstalled code
    in an adjacent directory, one could create a ".mylib" file that adds the
    necessary path.

    For example, consider this directory tree with two Perl distributions,
    Foo-Bar and Baz-Bam:

      ~/projects/
          Foo-Bar/
          Baz-Bam/

    The code in Foo-Bar depends on code in Baz-Bam. So in Foo-Bar, create a
    ".mylib" file with the appropriate path:

      $ cd Foo-Bar
      $ echo '../Baz-Bam/lib' > .mylib
      $ perl -Mylib Build.PL
      $ Build && Build test

    That's easier and shorter than using "PERL5LIB" on the command line, and
    it scales better as the number of libraries increases.

    In the example above, the "Build" script preserve @INC including the
    effect of "-Mylib" when it was created. This is not the case with
    "Makefile.PL" or "prove", in which case, "PERL5OPT" might be an
    alternative approach for using "-Mylib":

      $ export PERL5OPT=-Mylib
      $ prove
